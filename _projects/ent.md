<span class="strongword">The PRAGMA Experimental Networking Testbed (ENT) expedition goals include:</span> 
  
  
* Constructing, utilizing and providing access to a breakable international Software-defined Network (SDN)/OpenFlow testbed for use by PRAGMA researchers and collaborators.  


* Providing networking support to the PRAGMA multi-cloud and user-defined trust envelopes.


* Connecting resources in the US (University of Florida, UC San Diego and Indiana University), Japan (Nara
Institute of Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Techology and Osaka University) and 
Taiwan (national Applied Research Laboratories) with a goal of expanding the backbone of ENT to Thammasat University (TU) in Thailand.


* Establishing an international VLAN (virtual local area network) between TU and ENT.


* Continuing collaborations with researchers and students at Kasetsart University (KU) in Thailand to monitor and visualize the OpenFlow Network of PRAGMA-ENT.
