<div class="border">Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience
</div>

The PRAGMA community organized a peer reviewed special issue (Plale and Chen eds. 2017) 
which appeared in the April 2017 issue of **Concurrency and Computation: Practice and 
Experience**, John Wiley and Sons.  The special issue captures recent years' innovation and 
activity of PRAGMA, activity that builds on its foundation in grid and cloud computing and 
networks to advance scientific applications through focused scientific expeditions. The seven 
papers are introduced in an editor's letter (Plale and Chen 2017). They include a historical 
reflection (Arzberger 2017) and six research papers organized into three themes:  

1.  research that takes advantage of the unique international computer network of connected local clusters that 
    connect the PRAGMA institutions; 
2.  research that is inspired by science expeditions; these are focused activities around scientific challenges that are carried out within PRAGMA, 
3.  location-specific solutions that came about because of the long standing and nurturing 
    collaborative community that PRAGMA has built and fostered over a long period.
