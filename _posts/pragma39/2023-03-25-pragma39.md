On behalf of the organizing committee, we would like to welcome everyone to Jakarta for the 39th meeting of the Pacific Rim Applications and Grid Middleware Assembly (PRAGMA 39). This is the first PRAGMA workshop since the COVID-19 pandemic and will give us an opportunity to reconnect and reinvigorate our collaboration...

We look forward to seeing you in Jakarta on the 22nd - 24th June 2023!
