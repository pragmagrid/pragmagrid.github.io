<div class="border38">Overview </div>
Troves of big data are invaluable to all sectors of society, however deriving insight and understanding from such data requires interdisciplinary efforts and next generation technologies. One way to achieve this, is through the use of interactive visualization environments that can immerse the user in data and provide tools for data analytics. Thus, visualization can be considered a digital “lens” for big data from any discipline. It is especially valuable for researchers situated at distributed centers in Pacific Rim countries for data intensive applications including, but not limited to, natural disaster management, smart cities, sustainable water systems, climate change, and the creative arts.

The first part of this session will provide information on CyberCANOE environments. Both hardware requirements and SAGE2 software functionality will be presented. We will also present a series of application examples that highlight the use of this digital “lens” for big data. After the introduction, we will feature hands-on training to experience SAGE2 enabled visualization environments. Attendees will participate in a brainstorming session on SAGE2 that will highlight some of the features of these visualization environments. We expect ultimately that attendees will develop an understanding of how we are adding “smartness” to help researchers and the potential of these environments for data intensive science.
