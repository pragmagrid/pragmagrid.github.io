San Diego has one international airport (<a href="https://www.san.org/">San Diego International Airport</a>, USA). 
There are very few direct international flights to San Diego.  Most
international travelers will need to go thru San Francisco, California or Los Angeles, California.

- **Taxi** <br>
  The easiest way to travel from the airport is to take a taxi. Follow the
  signs to find the taxi counter outside the terminal.  Estimated taxi fare
  from airport to Hotel Sheraton: 45 USD (one way) <br>

- **Ride Share** <br>
  The cheapest way to travel from the airport is to do ride share via 
  <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a> or <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a>. 
  You will need to download their mobile app before you arrive and will need
  a working data plan for your phone.  Once you have your luggage, put the hotel address into
  the app and then follow the signs for <a
