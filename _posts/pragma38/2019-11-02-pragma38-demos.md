<div class="border38">Proceedings</div>
After the workshop, all presenters will be invited to submit a paper, about
four pages maximum length, related to your demo presentation.  The papers will
be collected and published on line as the first PRAGMA proceeding and will be
available at the second half of 2020.  The proceeding will give broader
audiences an understanding of how you through PRAGMA are advancing science
through your works, and for some, it provides a proof for your sponsor that
your presentation is published in a proceeding.
