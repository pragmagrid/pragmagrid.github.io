<div class="border38">Welcome to PRAGMA 38!</div>

On behalf of the organizing committee, we would like to welcome everyone to Hong Kong for the 38th meeting of the Pacific Rim Applications and Grid Middleware Assembly (PRAGMA 38). This workshop continues our long-standing effort in cyberinfrastructure research to support the long tail of science, namely small to medium sized distributed groups, to strengthen collaborations and nurture the next generation of scientists.

We look forward to seeing you in Hong Kong on the 11th - 14th March 2020!
