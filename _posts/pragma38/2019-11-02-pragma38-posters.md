All PRAGMA 38 attendees are welcome to submit posters (and associated
abstracts) to the PRAGMA 38 Poster Session, especially students. The poster
session offers the opportunity for presenters to share their work through a
quick introduction to the entire conference audience, followed by one-on-one
discussions next to the poster.

All posters must use the A1 format (594 x 841 mm/23.4 x 33.1 in).<br>
All submissions will be reviewed by PRAGMA Students Steering Committee and
decisions will be made available via email.<br>
Authors are expected to respond to review comments and, if necessary, resubmit
their updated poster and abstract.<br>
All accepted posters will also need to prepare a 1 min lightning talk (one
slide) of their work to be presented during the conference.<br>

<div class="border38">Proceedings</div>
After the workshop, all poster authors will be invited to submit a paper,
about four pages maximum length, related to your demo presentation.  The
papers will be collected and published on line as the first PRAGMA proceeding
and will be available in the second half of 2020.  The proceeding will give
broader audiences an understanding of how you through PRAGMA are advancing
science through your works, and for some, it provides a proof for your sponsor
that your presentation is published in a proceeding.
