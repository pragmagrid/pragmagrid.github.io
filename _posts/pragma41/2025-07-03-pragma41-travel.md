- **Taxi** <br>
  The easiest way to travel from the airport is to take a taxi. Taxi counter is
  available right in front of the international arrival gate. If you took
  a transit from KUL, then you will be exiting from the domestic arrival gate.
  You will need to walk farther to the exits before you can see the Taxi counter. 
  <br>
  You do not need to worry on the taxi availability as they will be available
  24/7. Read [this](https://www.penangairportonline.com/penang-airport-transportation/)  
  for more info.

- **Hotel Airport Transfer** <br>
  Most hotels provide airport transfer; you can check on this when you made the
  hotel reservation.

- **GrabCar**<br>
Grab has become a popular alternative to taxi as it offers a much lower cost
than taxis. You can download Grab Mobile Application from [Google
Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grabtaxi.passenger&hl=en).
