It is a true pleasure to welcome you to PRAGMA 41 at Thammasat University. Nearly a decade after hosting PRAGMA 31 in 2016, we are honored to once again support this active and collaborative community. Thammasat is proud to support this effort and to contribute to advancing regional and cross-regional collaboration.<br><br>
For our local team, it has been a privilege to support this gathering of passionate researchers, developers, and collaborators from across the PRAGMA community. This year’s theme, “Collaborative TechScapes: Innovating Together for Future Societies,” aligns closely with the university’s mission to promote inclusive, sustainable innovation with real-world relevance.  While the program speaks for itself, our role has been simply to help create the space—logistically and intellectually—for meaningful exchange to happen.<br><br>
Many of us have grown within this community, learning from its hands-on approach, its openness, and its emphasis on working solutions. We hope PRAGMA 41 continues that tradition, offering opportunities not only to present and prototype but to collaborate in ways that extend far beyond this week.<br><br>
Thank you for making the journey to be here. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to any of us throughout your time in Thailand. We’re here to help—and happy to learn alongside you.<br><br>
