On behalf of the organizing committee, we would like to welcome everyone to
Thailand for the 41st meeting of the Pacific Rim Applications and Grid
Middleware Assembly (PRAGMA 41). PRAGMA 41 will be held January 8-10, 2026 at
Thammasat University Rangsit Center in Pathumthani province.  This workshop
continues our long-standing effort in cyberinfrastructure research to support
the long tail of science, namely small to medium sized distributed groups, to
strengthen collaborations and nurture the next generation of scientists.
