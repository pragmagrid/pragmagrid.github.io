# Thailand Digital Arrival Card (TDAC)

The **Thailand Digital Arrival Card (TDAC)** is an online immigration form that replaces the old paper form (known as **TM6**) that passengers used to fill out on the airplane.  

Instead of writing on paper, you now submit your personal details, flight information, and health declaration online before you leave your home country.
