# Thailand Digital Arrival Card (TDAC)

The **Thailand Digital Arrival Card (TDAC)** is an online immigration form that replaces the old paper form (known as **TM6**) that passengers used to fill out on the airplane.  

Instead of writing on paper, you now submit your personal details, flight information, and health declaration online **before** you leave your home country.
