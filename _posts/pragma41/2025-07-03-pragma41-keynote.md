<h3>Talk Title: “High-Resolution Weather and Climate Forecasting Models for Thailand: Towards Climate Resilience and Risk Management”</h3>
Abstract: Thailand’s diverse tropical climate presents unique challenges for accurate weather and climate forecasting, especially as extreme events such as heavy rainfall, flash floods, and droughts become more frequent under changing global conditions. This presentation highlights advances in high-resolution weather and climate modeling tailored for Thailand, focusing on model development, data assimilation, and the integration of satellite, ground-based, and citizen-sourced observations to improve spatial and temporal accuracy. It also discusses the use of downscaling and ensemble forecasting techniques to enhance local predictions, along with practical applications in agriculture, water resource management, disaster preparedness, and urban planning. Drawing from experiences at CPS Weather and CPS Agri, the talk illustrates how data-driven modeling and regional collaboration can strengthen climate resilience and sustainable decision-making in Thailand and across Southeast Asia.

King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL), Thailand
<br><br>
Dr. Sorasak Danworaphong is a Thai physicist specializing in wave physics, acoustic materials, and noninvasive sensing technologies. He earned his Ph.D. in Physics from Brown University, USA, and is currently Associate Professor and Vice Dean of the Institute of Music, Science, and Engineering at KMITL. His research spans eco-friendly acoustic panels from natural biomass, sound absorption studies, and the manipulation of surface waves for environmental and engineering applications. He also develops 3D-printed musical instruments and hands-on learning kits, demonstrating how physics can bridge science, sustainability, and culture. <br>

<h3>Talk Title: “From Sound to Sustainability: Wave-Based Technologies for a Resilient Future”</h3>
Abstract: Sound is more than what we hear—it is a medium that connects science, culture, and sustainability. This talk explores how wave-based technologies can advance environmental resilience and cultural preservation. Drawing from research in acoustic materials, environmental monitoring, and noninvasive sensing, the presentation highlights innovations that use sound to reduce noise pollution, enable material sustainability, and support cultural preservation. Examples include eco-friendly acoustic panels made from natural biomass, wireless acoustic sensor networks for real-time noise mapping, and the creation of 3D-printed musical instruments precisely tuned to traditional scales. Together, these projects demonstrate how the science of sound can bridge physics, engineering, and art to build a more sustainable and human-centered future.

Faculty of Architecture and Planning, Thammasat University, Thailand<br>
Urban Futures and Policy Research Unit
<br><br>
Associate Professor Dr. Wijitbusaba Marome is a distinguished scholar and practitioner in urban development planning, with expertise in urban resilience, climate change adaptation, and sustainable cities. She serves as Associate Professor at the Faculty of Architecture and Planning, Thammasat University, and is the Founder and Director of the Urban Futures and Policy Research Unit, where she leads interdisciplinary research on urban innovation and resilience policy. Dr. Marome holds a Ph.D. in Planning from University College London, an M.Sc. in Gender and International Relations from the University of Bristol, and a Bachelor’s degree in Architecture from Chulalongkorn University. Her research integrates spatial planning, social engagement, and governance to address complex urban challenges. She has contributed to international collaborations with organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and served on Thailand’s Eastern Economic Corridor Development Fund and Bangkok Development Strategic Committee, advancing the national dialogue on sustainable urban policy and local climate action.<br>
<br>
<h3>Talk Title:  “Innovative Pathways to Urban Resilience: Integrating Community Engagement and Policy for Sustainable Cities”</h3>
Abstract: As cities face mounting challenges from climate change, resource stress, and rapid urbanization, the quest for urban resilience requires integrating community participation with forward-thinking policy innovation. In this keynote, Associate Professor Dr. Wijitbusaba (Ann) Marome shares her extensive experience in shaping resilient and adaptive cities through participatory planning and evidence-based policymaking. Drawing from her research on serious games for community engagement, climate adaptation, and COVID-19 preparedness, Dr. Marome will highlight tools and frameworks that enhance disaster risk awareness and empower local actors in shaping sustainable urban futures. Through Thai and international case studies, she will demonstrate how co-created knowledge, inclusive governance, and locally led climate actions can transform urban systems into adaptive, equitable, and future-ready environments.
