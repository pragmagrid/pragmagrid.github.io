On behalf of the organizing committee, we would like to welcome everyone to
Malaysia for the 40th meeting of the Pacific Rim Applications and Grid
Middleware Assembly (PRAGMA 40). This workshop continues our long-standing
effort in cyberinfrastructure research to support the long tail of science,
namely small to medium sized distributed groups, to strengthen collaborations
and nurture the next generation of scientists.

We look forward to seeing you in Penang on the 9th - 12th October 2024.
