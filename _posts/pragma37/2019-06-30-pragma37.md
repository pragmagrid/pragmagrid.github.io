<div class="border37">Welcome to PRAGMA 37!</div>

On behalf of the organizing committee, we would like to welcome everyone to San Diego for the 37th meeting of the Pacific Rim Applications and Grid Middleware Assembly (PRAGMA 37). This workshop continues our long-standing effort in cyberinfrastructure research to support the long tail of science, namely small to medium sized distributed groups, to strengthen collaborations and nurture the next generation of scientists.

<!-- The theme for the PRAGMA 37 workshop is TBD. -->

This is the fourth time PRAGMA has met in San Diego. San Diego last hosted
in 2010 for PRAGMA 18 and first hosted in 2002 for the very first PRAGMA
meeting.

We look forward to seeing you in San Diego on the 11th - 14th September 2019!
