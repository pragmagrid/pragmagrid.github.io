<p>
Since PRAGMA membership is at institutional level, benefits include:
<ul>
<li>setting future directions of research and development, </li>
<li>testing new software and technologies, <?li>
<li>accessing resources for development and application, </li>
<li>providing students opportunities for research and leadership opportunities, </li>
<li>hosting workshops, </li>
<li>building longer-term collaborations</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
and much more. The following statements are a few examples of the membership benefits.
</p>

  <h4>Osaka University and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT)</h4> 
</div>

<p>We have been developing technologies for cyberinfrastructure. By actively participating in a large community such as PRAGMA, 
we can contribute our technology to real-world use in science. For example, the OptIPlanet infrastructure became an example for 
future cyberinfrastructure with applications to telescience, geoscience and e-culture. Sensor networks are also foundations for 
cyberinfrastructure in environmental monitoring such as GLEON and urban monitoring. An educational component is mandatory for 
international collaborative science. PRIME was one of the key components of our lab in terms of Japanese students as well as 
international collaboration. Because we valued this PRAGMA effort involving education, we initiated a sister program, PRIUS, 
which sent our students to PRAGMA institutes. The large-scale international collaboration that happens in PRAGMA is unique. 
Therefore, for students especially, joining this international collaboration team is a real value.</p>

  <h4>National Applied Research Laboratory (NARL) and the National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC)</h4> 
</div>

<p>The National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC) has been a member of PRAGMA since 2002 and has continuously 
participated in PRAGMA workshops and associated activities. NCHC is one of the eleven national laboratories affiliated with the 
National Applied Research Laboratories (NARL). Learning from the PRAGMA collaboration, NCHC has built grid application platforms 
which have led to extensive involvement from NARL. For example, in addition to NCHC, both the NARL headquarters and the National 
Space Organization (NSPO) have been deeply involved with the GEO Working Group and have achieved the Aster/Formosat-2 image 
federation with PRAGMA colleagues at AIST. The National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) participates 
in the Telescience Working Group, and through this PRAGMA alliance, NCREE strengthened its relationship with the US NSF Network 
for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) program. The Taiwan Ocean
Research Institute (TORI) - following the path of the PRAGMA 
Telescience Working group - with technical support from NCHC, has deployed a coral reef observatory site at Orchid Island that is 
able to support marine biology research studies in Taiwan, as well as across the globe. In the near future, we anticipate more 
institutes under NARL with research interests in earth observations will take part in PRAGMA activities and collaborations.</p>

  <h4>College of Computer Science & Technology (CCST), Jilin University</h4> 
</div>

<p>Jilin University (JLU) is a leading national university under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education of China. 
The College of Computer Science &amp; Technology (CCST) of JLU became a member of PRAGMA at the PRAGMA 9 workshop, held in 2006. 
Since then, PRAGMA has provided CCST with many opportunities to participate in international grid activities and build close 
collaborations with other PRAGMA members.</p>

<p>
CCST joined both the Biosciences and Resource Working Groups of PRAGMA. Each group has a specific focus and projects that 
enable people to work together and make progress. Through working group activities, CCST is able to feel the pulse of 
technology development in the high-performance computing (HPC) arena and is able to better know how scientists in other 
areas use HPC to conduct their research.</p>

<p>
CCST is involved in the Avian Flu project, an international project in the Biosciences Working Group, which is aimed at 
building a comprehensive grid platform to use simulations and in silico screening to support the fight against avian influenza virus. 
The Avian Flu project provided specific usage scenarios for meta-scheduling; this pushed CCST to develop a number of useful features 
in meta-scheduler CSF4, including the following: array job, working flow, data staging in/out, and application aware scheduling.</p>

<p>
CCST has established close relationships with the Opal team, Gfarm team, and other research groups in the PRAGMA community. 
Several CCST faculty members and graduate students have become short-term visiting researchers at UCSD. In turn, UCSD researchers 
have visited CCST on several occasions. In the last few years, CCST has co-published approximately ten papers with PRAGMA 
researchers in international journals and conferences, such as New Generation Computing, e-Science, Grid and Cloud Computing (GCC), 
Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications (ISPA), Grid Computing and Applications (GCA), Grid and Distributed 
Computing (GDC), and others.</p>

<p>
Above all, PRAGMA brings great value to CCST in terms of broadening international collaboration, engaging applications, 
publishing scientific papers, and cultivating student.</p>

  <h4>Monash University</h4> 
</div>

<p>Monash University has benefited from involvement in PRAGMA since its inception in 2002. The Monash e-Science and Grid Engineering 
(MeSsAGE) Lab specializes in the development of software tools and techniques for programming e-Science applications. e-Science 
is characterized by computationally intensive modeling and/or large data processing requirements. Due to the scale of computing 
required to support e-Science it is usually carried out across distributed environments such as grids and clouds, which requires 
high levels of collaboration between application scientists and distributed-computing specialists.</p>

<p>
PRAGMA provides a unique incubator for this kind of collaborative science. Researchers in various disciplines from leading 
institutions provide a diversity of expertise, ripe with scientific opportunity. MeSsAGE Lab focuses on application development 
motivated by underlying scientific goals, rather than on technology for its own sake. This is why PRAGMA involvement is so important 
for us - there are always PRAGMA members working on interesting problems ready to push the boundaries of what we do.</p>

<p>
In 2010, MeSsAGE Lab had the pleasure of hosting five students participating in the PRIME program, all of them working on projects 
related to e-Science. PRIME is another great PRAGMA opportunity for engagement, plus it has the added benefit of bringing some new 
friends to the Lab each year. At the PRAGMA 18 Workshop in March 2010, we identified and embarked on a collaboration with the
Costa Rica Institute of Technology, modeling ash fallout from volcanic eruptions (please see NG-TEPHRA in the Key 
Collaborative Successes section). Early work has already been accepted for international publication, 
with full-scale modeling and a data visualization workflow to follow.</p>
