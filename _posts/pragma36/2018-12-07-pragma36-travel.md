Travelers who carry internationally recognized credit cards can get a cash advance in Korea Won from Automated 
Teller Machines (ATMs) installed at airports, major hotels, department stores, subway stations and 
tourist attractions. ATMs are in operation 24 hours a day. Most large stores, hotels and restaurants in
