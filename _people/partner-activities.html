<h2>Partner and Other Community Activities</h2>
<p>
     
<ul>
  <li> <P><strong><a href="http://gleon.org" target="_blank">GLEON</a></strong>, the Global Lakes Ecological Observatory Network, whose mission is to understand, predict and communicate 
  the role and response of lakes in a changing global environment.
  <p>
  <li> <P><strong><a href="http://www.globalcentra.org" target="_blank">CENTRA</a></strong>, Collaborations to Enable Transnational Cyberinfrastructure Applications, 
  whose long-term goal is advancing scientific understanding of distributed software-defined cyberinfrastructure through partnerships and
    evolving a framework for collaborations amongst research centers, 
    institutes and laboratories across the world.  CENTRA engages junior researchers in software-defined infrastructure, with 
    initial drivers of environmental modeling, disaster management and smart cities.
    <p>
 <li> <P><strong>Lower Mekong Region:</strong> At PRAGMA 31 researchers from the Lower Mekong Region (a critical geographic area for Southeast Asia), PRAGMA and CENTRA met to 
   discuss the need for data sharing, as well as possible approaches to creating a capable and accessible database to support data sharing. 
   The data under discussion covered areas of hydrology, biodiversity (indicator species), land use coverage and population distribution.  
    <p> 
  <li> <P><strong><a href="http://www.nsrc.org" target="_blank">Network Startup Resource Center</a></strong>, based at the University of Oregon, was estasblished in 1992 to provide technical assistance
    to organizations setting up computer networks seeking to connect to the NSFNET 
    in support of international scientific research and education.  Through coordinated technical training programs and direct
    engineering assistance in more than 100 countries over the past couple of decades, the NSRC builds institutional capacity to support 
    the research community, and leverages U.S. research infrastructure to bring value to international researchers and educators.  NSRC 
    has worked with the PRAGMA commmunity for several years in the Southeast ASia region to fund researchers from Myanmar, Philippines 
    and Thailand to attend PRAGMA meetings and engage with the regional science community.  The NSRC is partially funded by the International Research Network Connections (IRNC)
    program of the National Science Foundation and Google, with additional contributions from dozens of public and private organizations.
    <p>
  <li> <P><strong><a href="https://event.nchc.org.tw/2016/seaip/" target="_blank">SEAIP</a></strong>, Southeast Asia International Research and Training Program, hosted annually by the National Center for 
    High-performance Computing (NCHC), to promote collaborations in cyberinfrastructure among researchers in Southeast Asia and between those 
  researchers and others around the world.</li>
