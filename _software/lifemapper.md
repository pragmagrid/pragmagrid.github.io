[Lifemapper][3], an open-source modeling environment created at the University of Kansas, allows researchers to pursue species distribution and macroecological modeling for biogeographic and biodiversity analyses of terrestrial species. 

The Virtual Biodiversity Expedition (VBE) is utilizing unique Lifemapper installations for PRAGMA sites using species occurrence data of local interest or specified by a researcher, and phylogenetic (evolutionary) data derived from DNA sequencing studies to explain the ecological and evolutionary contributions to observed spatial patterns of species diversity.

PRAGMA-Lifemapper tools for installing and configuring Lifemapper third party dependencies, configuring installation for local hardware, and bootstrapping the database with default or user data. 

GitHub repositories contain code for installation of the two primary components (server and compute) of Lifemapper:

[lifemapper-server][1] 

[lifemapper-compute][2]


The core Lifemapper code is available at:
