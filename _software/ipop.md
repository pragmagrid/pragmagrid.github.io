**IPOP** (IP-over-P2P) is an open-source user-centric software virtual network
allowing end users to define and create their own virtual private networks
(VPNs). IPOP virtual networks provide end-to-end tunneling of IP or Ethernet
over *TinCan* links setup and managed through a control API to create various
software-defined VPN overlays.
